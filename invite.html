            <p>We're trying to make it easier to schedule and know where
            gamenight is going to be every week, and know earlier when one is
            scheduled.</p>
            <p>If you want to host gamenight, please enter when and where you'd
            like to host, and select how important it is to you to host at that
            time. The idea is, sometimes you might be saying "I want there to
            be a gamenight, and I'm happy to volunteer my house for that." Some
            other times, there's a particular reason you <strong>want</strong>
            to host gamenight, and you should indicated that.</p>
            <p>When it's time to schedule a gamenight (usually around Tuesday
            morning), the system will try to pick the person who wanted to host
            that week's gamenight most. If no one volunteered to host, it will
            send out an email to people who have asked for it, suggesting they
            perhaps host.</p>
            <p>If you'd like to get that email (only if there are no gamenight
            invitations for the week), select 'get nag email' in your <a
            href="/profile">profile page</a>.<p>
